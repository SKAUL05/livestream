I am very happy and elated that you considered working on this project. Being a contributor to this project you confirm that:

- You have done your work properly and it's not plagiarized
- Your work will be distributed under [MIT License](License) once your pull request is merged
- Your submitted work fulfils or mostly fulfils proper styles and standards

**New features** are Welcome! Though I would highly recommend to go through the issues page and work on current issues if possible. <br>
**Improving/Adding/Creating Testcases** and **Documentation** are highly respected and welcome.

### Contribution

Any contribution is appreciated, from fixing a grammar mistake in a comment to implementing complex algorithms. Please read this section if you are contributing to your work.

Keep issue list small by adding fixes: #{\$ISSUE_NO} to the commit message of pull requests that resolve open issues.

### Standards for code while working

- The file extension for python code should be `.py` and for javascript should be `.js`.
- Backend code as of now is developed in file `backend.py`.
- Please avoid creating new directories if at all possible. Try to fit your work into the existing directory structure.
- Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name, as it will be easy to parse in future using scripts.
- If you have modified/added code work, make sure the code compiles on your local before submitting.
- If you have modified/added documentation work, ensure your language is concise and contains no grammar errors.

I hope you enjoy contributing to this project.
